"""
    flagmutations{M<:MutationType,N<:Nucleotide}(::Type{M}, seqs::Matrix{N})

For every pair of sequences, flag which base positions are mutations of type `T`.

This function returns a tuple of two matrices. Both matrices contain logical
values, and contain a column for every pairwise combination of sequences,
and a number of rows equal to the length of the aligned sequences.

For the first matrix, for a cell of a given column,
a value of `true` indicates that there is a mutation of type `T` between two
sequences at that base position.

For the second matrix, for a cell of a given column,
a value of `true` indicates that there is an ambiguous base in either of the two
sequences at that base position, consequently it is not possible to conclude
whether there is a mutation at that base position or not.

**Note: This method assumes that the sequences are stored in the `Matrix{N}`
provided as `seqs` in sequence major order i.e. each column of the matrix is one
complete nucleotide sequence.**
