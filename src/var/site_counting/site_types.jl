A `Certain` site describes a site where both of two aligned sites are not an
ambiguity symbol or a gap.

An `Ambiguous` site describes a site where either of two aligned sites are an
ambiguity symbol.

An `Gap` site describes a site where either of two aligned sites are a
gap symbol '-'.

A `Match` site describes a site where two aligned nucleotides are the
same biological symbol.

A `Mismatch` site describes a site where two aligned nucleotides are not the
same biological symbol.

"""
A `Mismatch` site describes a site where two aligned nucleotides are definately
conserved. By definately conserved this means that the symbols of the site are
non-ambiguity symbols, and they are the same symbol.

A `Mutated` site describes a site where two aligned nucleotides are definately
mutated. By definately mutated this means that the symbols of the site are
non-ambiguity symbols, and they are not the same symbol.

"""
A `Transition` site describes a site where two aligned nucleotides are definately
mutated, and the type of mutation is a transition mutation.
In other words, the symbols must not be ambiguity symbols, and they must
be different such that they constitute a transition mutation: i.e. A<->G, or C<->T.

A `Transversion` site describes a site where two aligned nucleotides are definately
mutated, and the type of mutation is a transversion mutation.
In other words, the symbols must not be ambiguity symbols, and they must
be different such that they constitute a transversion mutation: i.e. A<->C,
A<->T, G<->T, G<->C.
