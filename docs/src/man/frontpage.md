# The Bio.jl User Manual

This User manual is an in-depth guide to the modules provided by the Bio.jl
package, and how to use the data-types and methods contained within to
complete common bioinformatics tasks.

If you are browsing this manual online you will notice a green Gitter chat tab
on the bottom-right of your screen. If you have questions when reading this
manual, you are welcomed to ask questions to our user and developer community.
If the question is a more involved one, they may ask you to start a post at the
[Julia Discourse Site](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/bio).
