# Intervals: Genomic Interval Manipulation

```@meta
CurrentModule = Bio.Intervals
```

The `Intervals` module consists of tools for working efficiently with genomic
intervals.


## Interval types

Intervals in Bio.jl are consistent with ranges in Julia: *1-based and
end-inclusive*. When data is read from formats with different representations
(i.e. 0-based and/or end-exclusive) they are always converted automatically.
Similarly when writing data. You should not have to reason about off-by-one
errors due to format differences while using functionality provided in Bio.jl.

The `Interval` type is defined as
```julia
type Interval{T} <: AbstractInterval{Int64}
    seqname::StringField
    first::Int64
    last::Int64
    strand::Strand
    metadata::T
end
```

The first three fields (`seqname`, `first`, and `last`) are mandatory arguments
when constructing an `Interval` object. `seqname` is the sequence name
associated with the interval. The `first` and `last` fields are the leftmost and
rightmost positions of the interval, which can be accessed with `leftposition`
and `rightposition` functions, respectively.

The `strand` field can take four kinds of values listed in the next table:

| Symbol | Constant      | Meaning                           |
| :----- | :------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| `'?'`  | `STRAND_NA`   | strand is unknown or inapplicable |
| `'+'`  | `STRAND_POS`  | positive strand                   |
| `'-'`  | `STRAND_NEG`  | negative strand                   |
| `'.'`  | `STRAND_BOTH` | non-strand-specific feature       |

Similarly to the `SeqRecord` type in the `Bio.Seq` module, `Interval` is
parameterized on metadata type, which lets it efficiently and precisely be
specialized to represent intervals from a variety of formats.


The default strand and metadata values are `STRAND_BOTH` and `nothing`:
```jlcon
julia> Interval("chr1", 10000, 20000)
Bio.Intervals.Interval{Void}:
  sequence name: chr1
  leftmost position: 10000
  rightmost position: 20000
  strand: .
  metadata: nothing

julia> Interval("chr1", 10000, 20000, '+')
Bio.Intervals.Interval{Void}:
  sequence name: chr1
  leftmost position: 10000
  rightmost position: 20000
  strand: +
  metadata: nothing

```

The following example shows all accessor functions for the five fields:
```jlcon
julia> i = Interval("chr1", 10000, 20000, '+', "some annotation")
Bio.Intervals.Interval{String}:
  sequence name: chr1
  leftmost position: 10000
  rightmost position: 20000
  strand: +
  metadata: some annotation

julia> seqname(i)
"chr1"

julia> leftposition(i)
10000

julia> rightposition(i)
20000

julia> strand(i)
STRAND_POS

julia> metadata(i)
"some annotation"

```


## Collections of intervals

Collections of intervals are represented using the `IntervalCollection` type,
which is a general purpose indexed container for intervals. It supports fast
intersection operations as well as insertion, deletion, and sorted iteration.

Interval collections can be initialized by inserting elements one by one using
`push!`.

```julia
# The type parameter (Void here) indicates the interval metadata type.
incol = IntervalCollection{Void}()

for i in 1:100:10000
    push!(incol, Interval("chr1", i, i + 99))
end
```

Incrementally building an interval collection like this works, but
`IntervalCollection` also has a bulk insertion constructor that is able to build
the indexed data structure extremely efficiently from an array of intervals.

```julia
incol = IntervalCollection([Interval("chr1", i, i + 99) for i in 1:100:10000])
```

Bulding `IntervalCollections` in one shot like this should be preferred when
it's convenient or speed in an issue.


## Intersection

There are number of `eachoverlap` function in the Intervals module. They follow
two patterns: interval versus collection queries which return an iterator over
intervals in the collection that intersect the query, and collection versus
collection queries which iterate over all pairs of overlapping intervals.

```@docs
eachoverlap
```

The order of interval pairs is the same as the following nested loop but
`eachoverlap` is often much faster:
```julia
for a in intervals_a, b in intervals_b
    if isoverlapping(a, b)
        # do something...
    end
end
```


## Interval streams

Intervals need not necessarily stored in an indexed data structure for efficient
intersection to be practical. Two collections of intervals need only be both
sorted to compute all intersecting pairs. This is particularly useful in
genomics where datasets are sometimes so large that loading them entirely into
memory is not practical.

The Intervals module is able to intersect any two iterators that yield intervals
in sorted order, which we refer to as "interval streams". An
`IntervalCollection` is also an interval stream, but so is a sorted array of
intervals, and parsers over interval file formats. This allows for a very
general notion of intersection.

```julia
for (x, y) in eachoverlap(open(BEDReader, "x_features.bed"), open(BEDReader, "y_features.bed"))
    println("Intersection found between ", x, " and ", y)
end
```

An exception will be thrown if an interval in encountered out of order while
processing an interval stream. Ordering of intervals has one complication: there
is not necessarily a standardized way to order sequence names. By default in
Bio.jl intervals are sorted using a `Base.isless` comparison function that is a
default order in most command-line tools. The Intervals module also offers
`alphanum_isless` comparison that compares numbers numerically if they exist in
string, so that names like `chr1, chr2, chr10` end up in their natural order.

The `eachoverlap` function takes as an optional parameter an `isless` function to
use to compare sequence names to account for arbitrary sequence name orderings.

```julia
for (x, y) in eachoverlap(xs, ys, Bio.Intervals.alphanum_isless)
    println("Intersection found between ", a, " and ", b)
end
```

A special sort of intersection can also be performed on an interval stream
against itself to produce "coverage intervals".
